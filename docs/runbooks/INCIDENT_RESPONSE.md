# Incident Response Runbook

Use this runbook for suspected security, privacy, availability, or integrity incidents. Do not place secrets or sensitive payloads in incident channels, tickets, or screenshots.

## 1. Triage and contain

1. Open a restricted incident record; assign an incident lead and preserve timestamps/correlation IDs.
2. Assess affected users, services, data classification, active exposure, and operational risk.
3. Contain safely: revoke/rotate exposed credentials, disable a vulnerable route/provider, limit privileged access, or roll back to a known healthy deployment.
4. Preserve redacted evidence and avoid destructive changes that erase investigation data.

## 2. Communicate and recover

1. Notify only approved responders and stakeholders using the incident lead's communication plan.
2. Implement a tested remediation through the normal deployment path when feasible; record any emergency exception.
3. Verify recovery with health checks, error/latency metrics, audit events, and targeted user-flow validation.
4. Decide whether affected users, vendors, or regulators require notice; product-specific obligations are **TBD** and require owner review.

## 3. Close and learn

1. Document timeline, impact, root cause/contributing factors, containment, recovery, and remaining risk.
2. Create tracked follow-up tasks with owners and due dates in [TASKS.md](../TASKS.md).
3. Update an ADR, security control, test, alert, or this runbook when a gap was found.
4. Obtain owner sign-off before closure.
